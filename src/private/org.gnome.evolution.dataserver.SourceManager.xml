      CreateSources:
      @array: An array of "uid" and "data" pairs

      Creates a new data source for each "uid" and "data" string pair in
      @array and adds them to the list of managed objects.  The "uid" part
      is a unique identifier for the new source, and the "data" part is the
      raw key file data describing the new source.

  <!--
      Reload:

      Reloads the registry service as if it were stopped and restarted.
      Client applications will see all exported objects suddenly removed
      and replaced by a new and possibly different set of objects.

      The primary use case for this method is to rerun the data migration
      routines that run automatically on startup.

      A reload can also be triggered by sending the SourceManager process
      a SIGHUP on platforms that support it.
